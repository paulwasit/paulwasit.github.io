    "_Note: The median is not skewed much by extremely large or small values. So it may give a better idea of a 'typical' value than the mean. This is also why it is considered a [**robust statistic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics)._\n"

    "## Unimodality\n",
    "\n",
    "The peaks of a probability distribution (i.e. local maxima) are called modes (not to be confused with the mode defined in the previous section). A variable with only one mode (or peak) is called unimodal. If the probability distribution has more than one mode, the variable is called multimodal. \n",
