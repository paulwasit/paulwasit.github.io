    "More formally, let $X_{1},\\ldots ,X_{n}$ be a sequence of $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables drawn from a distribution of expected value $\\mu$ and finite variance $\\sigma ^{2}$. Its mean follows a normal distribution $N(\\mu ,s^{2})$ when $n$ is large, where $s$ is called the the standard error of the mean (SEM).\n",
