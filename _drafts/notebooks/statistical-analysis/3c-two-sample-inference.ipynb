    "The null hypothesis $H_0$ states that the population mean of two samples are equal: $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2$. The test statistic is $t=(\\bar {X_1}-\\bar {X_2}) / s$, where $s^2$ is a measure of common variance whose formula depends on whether the two samples have equal size and/or variance.\n",

    "Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a $t$-distribution (its degrees of freedom depend on the assumptions of equal or unequal variance). \n",

    "Note: Student's t-test assume equality of variance; the Welch's unequal variances t-test, or Welch U test, doesn't make such assumptions. The litterature [does not recommend](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/000711004849222) to test equality of variances before choosing between the two test. In general, using the Welch U test must be [preferred](https://www.rips-irsp.com/articles/10.5334/irsp.82/).\n"
